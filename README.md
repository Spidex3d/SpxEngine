SpxEngine is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its mine

Hi I'm The Dyslexic Programmer. I'm not really a programmer, I'm a retired horticulturist. iv been learning C++ for the last 20 months and found it very additive so I'm going to try and make a games engine using Opengl.

This is the second time I have tried to make a 3d games Engine from scratch in C++ the difference this time I have 20 months of experience now so this should help a little bit lol.
What should the engine be able to do, create a landscape with sky box which we can simply walk, drive or fly around and interact with in scene objects.
use the level editor to change and update levels 

Spidex 3d Game Engine version 2 OpenGL
Project Name SpxEngine

Core Engine *engine.lib
Level Editor SpxEngine *.exe

So what do we want are Games Engine to do;

Window
Render API
Shaders
GUI using ImGui
Debugging support using my Log.h
ECS entity component system
Object loader 
File I\O
scripting language ? or maybe just use some kind of set attribute for interacting with objects
physics system

file format
scripting language *.spx
Models *.obj - *.gltf 
Textures *.jpg - *.png

Libraries to use
GLFW
glad
ImGui 
glm
stb
